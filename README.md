Hi there, I am an emphatic computer science student, especially interested in software testing, automation and quality assurance. My course projects, similarly to my latest class assignments, demonstrate my dedication to building high-quality, robust, effective and secure software solutions.

Passionate about Code Quality

I further believe that a good software starts with quality. Having written tests for the past three years on all major functional areas in a Java applications, I’m confident that I could take on the challenge of testing any application. This involves ensuring that our code does not only meet user requirements, but that it’s capable of skillfully communicating to users and withstanding possible failures. The framework used is JUnit, and my biggest project using this framework, besides the one I face at present, has seen me deliver software of nothing but the best quality.

User-Centric Software Design

A primary strength of mine is my ability to translate user feedback into working software designs. By including users and other stakeholders in the development process, I can develop software that meets the expectations of the people it will eventually serve. Working with users from the beginning is a vital step in my work life and it has enabled me to develop effective solutions that make sense.

Methodical Approach to Software Development

The way I approach the software development process is very structured: I plan all the architecture and workflows before writing any line of code. For example, I use UML diagrams to think out the architecture of the application, and I use flowchart for the algorithms. This helps me to ensure the clarity of the process and all parts of the solution. Also, the outcome as a whole will be much more efficient and scalable.

Looking Forward

I look forward to advancing further in computer science, learning other advanced areas of software engineering like AI and machine learning, and pushing forward toward developing technology that can help change lives.
